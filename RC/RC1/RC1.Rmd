# Introduction to R and Rstudio
## Intro to Rstudio
### How to "write" using Rmarkdown
Create a new file through **File -> New File -> Rmarkdown**. Prefer choosing **HTML** as the default output format.
You can not start a new line without adding an extra blank line above.

Start a new line like this.  
Or you could add 2 or more spaces at the end of the last line to start a new line like this.

Press **"Knit"** button to see how this page is rendered. If you have *LaTeX* compiler on your computer, you may change the "output" to be **_"pdf_document"_** so that Rstudio will generate a pdf file using *LaTeX*.

For *LaTeX* equations, you may add an inline equation like this: $y = \beta_0+\beta_1x$, and add a display equation like this:
$$y = \beta_0+\beta_1x$$.

Insert images like this:  
![alt text](help_table.jpg)

You can find many helpful markdown reference here. Make sure that the image you insert should be in the folder where you save this .Rmd file. Otherwise, use absolute path.


## Intro to R
### Create a new R code chunk by pressing Ctrl+Alt+I
```{r}
# This is a R code chunk. Make sure you have ```{r} at the top of the chunk and ``` at the bottom.
# install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2) # Import library like this. If you don't have this package yet, install it using the code above. You can directly type this command in the Console below. Click "Packages" on your right panel to see what packages you've already installed.

# Run the code in the current chunk by clicking the green triangle at the top-right corner of this chuck.
# If you want to run only part of codes within a chunk(in the case where you don't want to reload the data again), select the corresponding code lines first, and then press Ctrl+Enter.
```


### Vectors(IMPORTANT)
* Create a vector: c() for concatenate
* Case of missing values: NA (not available) and NaN (not a number)
* Get a subset of a vector: my_vector[i] to get the ith element, **STARTING FROM 1**.
* Calculations with vectors: max(x), min(x), range(x), length(x), sum(x), mean(x), prod(x) (product of the elements in x), sd(x) (standard deviation), var(x) (variance), sort(x), order(x)
```{r}
# Create a numeric vector
vec = c(5, 3, 1, 6, 4, 2, 7, 9) # Basically no difference between "=" and "<-"
vec[1] # No need to use print()
vec[1:3] # First 3 elements
vec[c(2,4)] # The 2nd and 4th element of vec: 3, 6
# DIFFERENT FROM PYTHON!!!
vec[c(-2, -4)] # Not choose the 2nd and 4th element of vec: 5, 1, 4, 2
len = length(vec) # The length of vec
vec[len] # The last element of vec
# So far there are 2 variables created. You can find their info in the "Environment" on the right panel.

# Other ways to create vectors
v1 = c(1:8)
v1
v2 = seq(from = 3, to = 21, by =2)
v2
v3 = rep(5, 4) # rep(value, repeat_times)
v3
v4 = rep(v1, 2)
v4
v1 + vec # Add operation
c(v1, vec) # Concatenation
v1 = c(v1, 100) # Append
```


### Matrices
* Create and naming matrix: matrix(), cbind(), rbind(), rownames(), colnames()
* Check and convert: is.matrix(), as.matrix()
* Transpose a matrix: t()
* Dimensions of a matrix: ncol(), nrow(), dim()
* Get a subset of a matrix: my_data[row, col]
* Calculations with numeric matrices: rowSums(), colSums(), rowMeans(), colMeans(), apply()
* Matrix product: %*%
```{r}
v5 = c(1:6)
m1 = matrix(v5, nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)
m1
m2 = matrix(v5, nrow=2, byrow=FALSE)
m2
rowname = c("r1", "r2")
colname = c("c1", "c2", "c3")
m3 = matrix(v5, nrow=2, dimnames = list(rowname, colname)) # Default: byrow=FALSE
m3
t(m3) # Transform
m3[1, 2] # [row, col]
m3[1,] # First row
m3[,2] # Second col

m1*m3 # Element-by-element multiplication
m1 %*% t(m3) # Matrix multiplication

m4 = cbind(v1, vec) # Column bind
m4
m5 = rbind(v1, vec) # Row bind
m5
```


### DataFrame and Data Loading
Data.frame is a very special data structure in R. 
```{r}
data(iris) # Load data from R
dim(iris) # row, col. Could also be accessed by using nrow() and ncol() respectively.
head(iris) # View the data of the top 6 rows of the dataset
tail(iris, 3) # View the last 3 rows of the dataset
names(iris) # The names of each column
vec_species = iris$Species # Access the data of column "Species" by using $
vec_species[1] # Treat it as a vector
str(iris) #Structure
summary(iris)
table(iris$Species)
unique(iris$Species)
View(iris) # View the data in Rstudio. You could also double click this data in the "Environment" on the right panel.
```

If you want to get subdataset with Species='setosa', try **which** function.
```{r}
id = which(iris$Species=='setosa') # Return a vector of row index
iris_setosa = iris[id,]
iris_setosa = iris_setosa[,-5] # drop the 5th col 
head(iris_setosa)
```

The elements can be called as usually in matrix or by attribute name.
```{r}
iris[3,4]
iris$Petal.Length[4]
```

Basic operation functions.
```{r}
max(iris$Sepal.Length)
min(iris$Sepal.Length)
which.max(iris$Sepal.Length)
mean(iris$Sepal.Length)
median(iris$Sepal.Length)
sd(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

Load data from .csv file and create a new data.frame.
```{r}
data = read.csv("fuel2001.csv") # Load data
head(data)
Fuel = 1000*data$FuelC/data$Pop
Dlic = 1000*data$Drivers/data$Pop
newdata = data.frame(Fuel, data$Tax, Dlic, data$Income, log(data$Miles)) # Create a new data.frame
newdata$MPC = data$MPC # Append a new column
head(newdata)
```


### Basic graphs

R is very convenient to generate figures. Here are some basic graphics functions in R.

```{r}
pairs(iris) # Pairwise scatterplot
pairs(iris[1:3]) # Only use first 3 cols
pairs(~iris$Sepal.Length + iris$Petal.Length + iris$Petal.Width) # Choose specific cols
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # Let the following 4 plots be displayed together within a 2*2 block
hist(iris$Sepal.Length)
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length)
boxplot(iris)
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, xlab = "this is the x-axis",
    ylab = "this is the y-axis",
    main = "Plot of X vs Y")
```

Functions mentioned above could handle most of the graph-plotting problems in your homeworks. The professor also introduced how to use ggplot2 in the lecture and gave out its document link. You can learn it by yourself. At the end of this page, I list some of its usage that is introduced in UM's lab for your reference.


### If-else and for loop
```{r}
set.seed(1) # Set seed for random
for(i in c(1:3)){
  x1 = runif (100, min=-1, max=1) # runif() creates 100 samples from uniform distribution between range -1 to 1
  x2 = i * x1 + rnorm (100, mean=0, sd=1) / 10 # rnorm() create from normal distribution with mean=0 and standard_deviation=1
  y = 2 + 2 * x1 + 0.3 * x2 + rnorm (100)
  if(i != 2){
    plot(y, x1)
    abline(a = -0.5, b=1/4) # a is intercept, b is slope
    # https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2/topics/abline
  }
}
```


### **ggplot2** package

The library ggplot2 offers a plotting system with substantial capabilities and nicer graphics than the base plotting functions.

```{r c2}
# install.packages("ggplot2") 
# if you don't have this package, you need to install it.
library(ggplot2)
```

#### Geometric objects and aesthetics
Building blocks of a graph include: data, **aesthetic mapping**, **geometric object**, statistical transformations, scales, coordinate system, position adjustments and faceting.

**Aesthetic Mapping**: something you can see, for example, position, color, fill, shape, linetype, size and so on. Aesthetic mappings are set with the aes() function.

**Geometic Objects**: the actual marks we  put on a plot, for example, points(geom_point), lines(geom_line), histograms(geom_histogram).

#### Examples:

```{r c3}
#load data
data_crime = read.table("city_crime.txt", header = TRUE)
head(data_crime)
```

qplot() is a function which stands for quick plot. It has a lot of syntax which is similar to plot().

```{r c4}
plot(x = data_crime$Robbery, y = data_crime$Assault, xlab = 'Robbery', ylab = 'Assault', main = 'Crime')
```

```{r c5}
qplot(x = Robbery, y = Assault, data = data_crime, xlab = 'Robbery', ylab = 'Assault', main = 'Crime')
```

A plot must have at least one geom. 
```{r c6}
crime_plot <- ggplot(data = data_crime,aes(x = Robbery, y = Assault))

# scatterplot by using geom_point()
crime_plot + geom_point()
# lines
crime_plot + geom_line()
#color and size
crime_plot + geom_point(aes(color = Murder, size = Larceny))

crime_plot + geom_point(aes(color = Murder)) + 
  scale_colour_gradient(high = "red", low = "blue") + theme_bw()

#text
crime_plot + geom_text(aes(label=rownames(data_crime)), check_overlap = TRUE)
```

After creating your basic graph, what if you want to add a title, adjust the size of text?

```{r c7}
crime_plot <- ggplot(data = data_crime) + geom_point(aes(x = Robbery, y = Assault, color = Murder))
crime_plot <- crime_plot + labs(title = "Crime", x = 'Robbery', y = 'Assualt') 
crime_plot + theme(text = element_text(size=20))
# just change size of title
crime_plot + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20))
# annotate our graph
crime_plot + geom_abline(intercept = 1500, slope = -0.5) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = c(1500), y = c(800), label = c('separating hyperplane')), size = 5)
```

Pairs plots are useful to visualize multiple variables at the same time. The base function is **pairs**, but here is an example with **ggplot**.

```{r c8,message=FALSE}
#install.packages('GGally')
library(GGally)
crime_pairs = ggpairs(data_crime,axisLabels = "none",
        upper = list(continuous = "points", combo = "dot"),
        lower = list(continuous = "cor", combo = "dot"),
        diag = list(continuous = "densityDiag")) + 
  theme_bw()
crime_pairs
```

#### 3D plots

Sometimes it is useful to create 3D plots to visualize multivariate data. The library **plotly** can do so.

```{r c9,message=FALSE}
#install.packages('plotly')
library(plotly)
p = plot_ly(data_crime, x = ~Robbery, y = ~Assault, z = ~Murder,color=~Larceny)
p
```
