### Auto data
* Load the Auto dataset from *Auto.csv* using the read.csv() function. Show the top 5 rows.
* Make a boxplot of *cylinders* versus *mpg* and a histogram of *mpg*. Display them in the same row.
* Set the seed to be 100. Generate a vector *x_0* from standard normal distribution. The length should be equal to the row number of Auto.
* Make 4 scatterplots within a 2\*2 block. Points within each plot should be in gray color. Use a for-loop with parameter **i** from 4 to 1. Within each plot (5-i), **x** should be the vector "weight" of *Auto.csv*; and **y** should be equal to i\*x_0 + i^2. Append a blue dash line with line width=2. Make the title of each plot (5-i) to be "Figure (5-i)". Your output should be similar to the picture below. You may need to search for the usage the function **paste()** and **abline()**.
* Type the formula "y = i\*x_0 + i^2" using LaTeX in display mode(i.e. at the center).

$$y = i*x_0 + i^2$$


```{r}
data = read.csv("Auto.csv")
head(data, 5)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(data$cylinders, data$mpg)
hist(data$mpg)

set.seed(100)
x = rnorm(dim(data)[1])
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
for (i in c(4:1)){
  y = i*x + i^2
  plot(data$weight, y, xlab = paste("i=", i), main = paste("Figure", 5-i), col="gray")
  m = mean(y)
  abline(h = m, col="blue", lty=4, lwd=2)
}

```
